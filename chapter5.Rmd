#Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

In this chapter, we will practice dimensionality reduction techniques using "human" data which was originated from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Additional information about the data can be found [here](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi).

First we will load the data into R and get an overview of it.
```{r}
human<-read.table("data/human.csv")
head(human)
dim(human)
str(human)
```
